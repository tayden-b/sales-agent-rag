# What is HCP Vault Dedicated?

HCP Vault Dedicated is a hosted version of Vault Enterprise operated by HashiCorp
that allows organizations to get up and running quickly. HCP Vault Dedicated uses the same
binary as self-hosted Vault Enterprise, which means you will have a consistent user
experience. You can use the same CLI, API, and UI to communicate with HCP Vault Dedicated as
you use to communicate with a self-hosted Vault Enterprise.

You can create HCP Vault Dedicated clusters on either AWS or Azure across multiple regions
across North America, Asia, and Europe. HashiCorp manages the cloud provider
you select in an account dedicated to your organization.

## Why HCP Vault Dedicated?

Vault Enterprise running on the HashiCorp Cloud Platform (HCP) enables users to
secure, store, and control access to tokens, passwords, certificates,
and encryption keys within one unified cloud-based platform.

The benefits of HCP Vault Dedicated are:

- **Reduce operational overhead:** Push-button deployment, fully managed
  upgrades, and backups mean organizations can focus on adoption and integration
  instead of operational overhead.
- **Increase security across clouds and machines:** Secure your infrastructure
  across all your environments through a single interface and globally control
  and restrict access to sensitive data and systems.
- **Control cost:** Reduce the number of systems, licenses, and manual overhead
  by centralizing secrets management with HCP Vault Dedicated.
- **Day zero readiness:** Modern cloud security to secure applications,
  access, and data from day zero.
- **Reliability:** HashiCorp has experience supporting thousands of commercial
  Vault Enterprise clusters and HCP Vault Dedicated brings that expertise directly to
  users.
- **Ease of use:** HCP Vault Dedicated is built around making cloud security automation
  simple. Get up and running so that you can onboard applications and
  teams.

## Feature parity

Since HCP Vault Dedicated uses the same binary as Vault Enterprise, most enterprise
features are available to HCP Vault Dedicated users. Some features such as auto-unseal are
managed by HashiCorp to manage the cluster.

The table compares the features available on the self-managed Vault
Enterprise and HCP Vault Dedicated.

| Features | HCP Vault Dedicated | Self-managed |

| FIPS 140-2 & seal wrap | ❌ | ✅ |
| HSM auto-unseal | ❌ | ✅ |

Note

For self-managed Vault Enterprise clusters, audit logging is a manual
configuration. Similarly, if your self-managed Vault Enterprise is running with
[Integrated Storage](/vault/docs/configuration/storage/raft), you can configure
an automatic data snapshot. However, HCP Vault Dedicated automates the audit logging
process.

## Self-managed vs. HCP Vault Dedicated cluster

Here is a comparison between a self-managed Vault Enterprise cluster and
an HCP Vault Dedicated cluster.

| Cluster Feature | Self-managed | HCP Vault Dedicated |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Edition | Vault Community Edition or Vault Enterprise | Vault Enterprise |
| Version | Self-manage the upgrade process | Minor and major versions are upgraded for you automatically. See the [Vault version documentation](/hcp/docs/vault/versions) for more detail. |
| [Advanced Data Protection (ADP)](https://www.hashicorp.com/products/vault/advanced-data-protection) features | Available with Vault Enterprise license | Available with HCP Vault Dedicated Standard. |
| Cluster scaling | No built in feature to scale the cluster size up or down. | [Scale your cluster size](/vault/tutorials/cloud/vault-ops#scale-an-hcp-vault-cluster-up-or-down) dynamically via the HashiCorp Cloud Platform Portal or Terraform. |
| [Disaster recovery replication](/hcp/docs/vault/what-is-hcp-vault/high-avail-disaster-recover) | Available with Vault Enterprise license | Cross-region disaster recovery is available with HCP Vault Dedicated Standard and managed by HashiCorp. |
| [Performance replication](/vault/tutorials/manage-hcp-vault-dedicated/scale-out-vault) | Available with Vault Enterprise license | [Performance Replication](/vault/tutorials/cloud-ops/vault-replication) is available with HCP Vault Dedicated Standard. |
| Root/admin token | Vault initialization process generates a `root` token. To regenerate a `root` token, unseal keys or recovery keys are required. | Click on the **Generate token** button via HCP Vault Dedicated Portal returns an `admin` token which is valid for 6 hours. |
| [Secrets sync](/vault/docs/sync) | Available with Vault Enterprise license | Available with HCP Vault Dedicated Standard. |
| [Sentinel](/vault/docs/enterprise/sentinel) and [Control Groups](/vault/docs/enterprise/control-groups) | Available with Vault Enterprise license | Available with HCP Vault Dedicated Standard. |
| Storage backend | Choose one and self-manage | Integrated Storage |
| Seal | Seal uses Shamir's Secret Sharing algorithm to generate key shares by default. | Auto-unseal is configured. A unique Key Management Service (KMS) key is created for each cluster. |
| Tier sizing | Not applicable | For information on tier sizing and pricing, see [HCP Vault Dedicated Pricing](https://cloud.hashicorp.com/products/vault/pricing). |
| Top-level Namespace | `root` | `admin` |
